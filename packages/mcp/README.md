# MCP — Model Context Protocol

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The `mcp/` group connects the harness to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem of tool servers. The packages in this group attach an external server — a filesystem, GitHub, database, or memory server — so its tools are available to the model as native tools under stable server-qualified names. Each server is one configuration entry; nothing ships enabled, so you opt in per server. Only the Tools capability is bridged: MCP resources and prompts are not supported. This page maps the group; the package README owns the per-package contract.

## Packages

The group holds three packages; the package README and the links below own the details.

| Package | What it provides |
|---|---|
| [`mcp-client/`](mcp-client/README.md) | Attach one external MCP server so the model can call its tools as native tools |
| [`mcp-oauth/`](mcp-oauth/README.md) | Service Definition for the MCP OAuth capability seam (`ctx.mcpOAuth`) and its `mcpOAuth` Remote controller |
| [`mcp-oauth-web/`](mcp-oauth-web/README.md) | Web provider for `ctx.mcpOAuth`: SDK-driven OAuth discovery, dynamic registration, PKCE, one shared loopback callback route, and grant persistence through `ctx.credentials` |
